YAMLKit
=======

YAMLKit is an Objective-C library wrapping the [LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) library.

It is written by Patrick Thomson and licensed under the MIT License.

At this point it is quite mature, having been used in commercial projects on Mac and iOS.

Thanks to:

* Laurent Sansonetti for the idea and encouragement
* The LibYAML team
* Sebastian Nowicki for bringing this project back from the dead
